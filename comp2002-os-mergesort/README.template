## Assignment 3 Concurrency 

* Authors: Rachel Chien Wei Lew, Cooper Melville, Humaira Arief Azali
* Group name: Assignment 3 Groups 170

## Overview

Using the pthread library, a multi-threaded version of the merge-sort algorithm will be implemented.
This code will be used to concurrently sort a randomly generated array.

## Manifest

A listing of source files and other non-generated files, and a brief
(one-line) explanation of the purpose of each file.

mergesort.c         //contains the code implementation
mergesort.h         //declarations
test-mergesort.c    //tester file
Makefile            //build automation file

## Building the project

To compile using the Makefile, open a terminal and run 'make'

## Features and usage

Summarise the main features of your program. It is also appropriate to
instruct the user how to use your program.

# Features
- merge: This function combines two already sorted subarrays
- my_mergesort: This function splits an array into left and right subarrays and recursively sorts them, before merging
- parallel_mergesort: This function implements the multi-threaded version of mergesort, so it allows subarrays to be sorted concurrently instead of sequentially
- buildArgs: This is a helper function that builds arguments to be used by parallel_mergesort

# Using the program
- After building the project, run the executable test file: ./test-mergesort <input size> <cutoff level> <seed>
- input size: the size of the array
- cutoff level: the number of levels
- seed: initial value used to generate random numbers


## Testing

This section should detail how you tested your code. Simply stating "I ran
it a few times and it seems to work" is not sufficient. Your testing needs
to be detailed here.



## Known Bugs

List known bugs that you weren't able to fix (or ran out of time to fix).

## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your own?
What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this project? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT [https://chat.openai.com/] to learn more about the implementation of mergesort. The following prompts were entered into ChatGPT on 26 July 2025:
- How is merge affected if an array is not taken as a parameter?
- Why use a global or local temp array?
